# OneThemer

This application has been designed to help customise existing OneCommander themes visually - rather than modifying xaml in a text editor.\
The focus is purely on color changes, so for other theme changes you'll still need to get your hands dirty :)
\
\
How to use:  
Download and unzip the main file\
Launch OneThemer.exe\
The main screen will be shown:

When you select an item from the left hand list it appears in the middle section. 
Vertically next to this in the narrow column are shown minor color changes (ligher and darker) - any can be clicked
Alternatively select a color from one of the palette entries and tweak using this sliders.

Hovering over the entries in the left hand list shows a tooltip giving extra info on what the entry represents
